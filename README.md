# An-Analysis-of-Red-Hot-Chili-Pepper-s-Lyrics-Using-NLP

I heard Red Hot Chili Peppers for the first time about 10 years ago and I instantly became obsessed with them. They were (and still are) my #1 favorite band, right after Metallica, which I loved during my teenage years. Despite the fact that many people define RHCP as a typical "funk" band, their musical style has evolved over the years significantly. Early (pre-1999) RHCP's songs stood out by their explosive slap bass riffs, while post-1999 Peppers had become more melancholic. Does the same relationship hold for their lyrics though?

The goal of this project is to apply common text processing techniques (NLP) on Red Hot Chili Peppers's lyrics to test several theories and extract valuable insights from the data. In particular, I answer the following research questions:
- Which album is the most lyrically-sophisticated?
- Can albums be effectively summarized using topic modeling?
- Bonus question: are the songs *Dani California*, *Californication*, and *By The Way* talk about the same girl?
